# 482. License Key Formatting

## [题目](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/)

You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.

Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains *exactly* K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4

Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2

Output: "2-5G-3J"

Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
```

## 思路

- 先把字符串按逆序方向，去掉连接符，即将 “-” 替换成空串。
- 根据长度 K 截取

        :type S: str

        :rtype: str
        """
        S = S.replace("-", "").upper()[::-1]		# 先逆序
        return '-'.join(S[i:i+K] for i in range(0, len(S), K))[::-1]	# 截取后再逆序输出
